NON-STANDARDIZATION NOTICE

This document defines the original formulation of the Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP).

JTP is not a technical specification, implementation guideline, compliance framework,
evaluation metric, or certification standard. It is a normative principle whose purpose
is to function as a conceptual ground for human reflection, not as a system to be 
satisfied, enforced, or validated.

Accordingly:

- There is no concept of being "JTP-compliant" or "JTP-conformant."
- Any attempt to formalize JTP into a standard, checklist, score, or certification scheme
  is incompatible with the nature of this principle.
- No organization, institution, or authority may claim ownership, custodianship,
  or interpretive finality over JTP.

The role of JTP is not to optimize systems, assign responsibility, or stabilize governance
structures. Its role is to re-render perceptible the judgments that humans have delegated
to systems and subsequently ceased to perceive as judgments.

JTP exists to preserve awareness of where judgment exists, how it is displaced,
and how human agency is reconfigured through that displacement.

Any derivative interpretation, application, or implementation must clearly distinguish
itself from this original formulation and must not be represented as completing,
superseding, or redefining JTP.

This document retains normative primacy over all derivative discussions of JTP.

This document has equal normative effect in all language versions.
