# NON-STANDARDIZATION & SCOPE NOTICE  
*(Judgment Transparency Principle – Original Formulation)*
This document has equal normative effect in all language versions.

## 1. Purpose of This Notice

This document clarifies the intended scope, limits, and non-goals of the  
**Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)** as originally formulated.

JTP is presented as a **normative principle** concerned with the *perceivability of judgment*  
in systems affecting human actions or outcomes.

It is **not** presented as a standard, specification, checklist, or evaluative framework.

---

## 2. What JTP Is Not

The Judgment Transparency Principle **is not**:

- a technical standard or implementation specification  
- a compliance, certification, or audit criterion  
- a set of measurable or pass/fail requirements  
- a definition of safety, fairness, correctness, or accountability  
- a guarantee of ethical or acceptable outcomes  

Any representation of JTP as a basis for *conformance*, *certification*, or *compliance*
mischaracterizes the nature of the principle.

---

## 3. On Standardization and “Compliance”

JTP is **not designed to be standardized** in the sense of:

- ISO / IEC / IEEE–style normative standards  
- conformity assessment schemes  
- claims such as “JTP-compliant” or “JTP-certified”  

This position does **not** constitute a rejection of standardization as a practice.

Rather, JTP identifies a structural risk inherent in standardization:
when the conditions of judgment are fixed, certified, or declared compliant,
the responsibility for judgment may appear resolved,
even though it has merely been displaced.

For this reason, freezing JTP into a conformity framework
risks reintroducing the very form of judgment opacity
that the principle seeks to expose.

---

## 4. Relationship to Academic and Applied Work

Academic discussion, critique, empirical study, and applied experimentation
*inspired by* JTP are explicitly welcomed.

However:

- Derivative frameworks, metrics, or methodologies  
  **must not be represented as completing, finalizing, or superseding JTP**
- Empirical findings do not “validate” or “invalidate” the principle itself,
  but may illuminate how judgment perception operates in specific contexts
- No academic body or consensus is granted interpretive authority
  over the principle as a whole

JTP remains a **normative reference point**,  
not an object to be settled through scholarly closure.

---

## 5. On the Impossibility of Finalization

JTP intentionally resists completion.

The question it raises —  
*“Who is perceived as having made this judgment, and by whose delegation?”*  
cannot be permanently resolved without collapsing into a new form of opacity.

Any attempt to treat JTP as a finished doctrine,
closed theory,
or definitive framework
stands in tension with its core purpose.

---

## 6. Attribution and Reference

Use of the name **“Judgment Transparency Principle”** or **“JTP”**
implies reference to this original formulation.

Derivative interpretations or applications must be clearly identified as such
and must not be presented as authoritative versions of the principle.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

JTP does not exist to provide answers.

It exists to ensure that,
where judgments shape human outcomes,
the existence, boundary, and delegation of those judgments
remain visible,
questionable,
and open to responsibility.
