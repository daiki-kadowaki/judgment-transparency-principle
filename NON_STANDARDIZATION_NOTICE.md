# Non-Standardization and Non-Compliance Notice

## Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)

---

## 1. Scope and Intent

The Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP) defines a **normative principle**, not a
technical specification, implementation guideline, evaluation framework,
certification scheme, or compliance standard.

This document exists to explicitly prevent the misrepresentation of JTP as a
standardizable, certifiable, or compliance-based framework.

---

## 2. Prohibition of Standardization

JTP MUST NOT be:

- standardized,
- formalized into a technical or normative specification,
- incorporated into any standards body process (including but not limited to ISO,
  IEEE, W3C, or equivalent organizations),
- reduced to measurable criteria, checklists, benchmarks, or scoring systems.

Any attempt to standardize JTP fundamentally contradicts its purpose and
constitutes a misinterpretation of the principle itself.

Standardization inherently fixes boundaries, whereas JTP exists precisely to
expose the contingency and arbitrariness of judgment boundaries.

---

## 3. Prohibition of Compliance and Certification Claims

No system, organization, product, or policy may claim to be:

- “JTP-compliant”,
- “JTP-aligned”,
- “certified under JTP”,
- or equivalent expressions implying conformance, adherence, or fulfillment.

JTP is not a requirement to be satisfied, but a condition to be recognized.
Claims of compliance falsely imply that judgment transparency can be completed,
verified, or finalized.

---

## 4. Non-Delegability of Interpretive Authority

Interpretation of JTP must not be centralized, delegated, or institutionalized
into any authoritative body, committee, academic discipline, or governance
structure.

Any interpretation presented as definitive, official, or final constitutes a
violation of the principle.

JTP remains intentionally open to contestation, critique, and reinterpretation.

---

## 5. Relationship to Academic and Technical Work

Academic research, technical implementations, or applied discussions may
reference JTP **only as an originating normative principle**.

Such works must not present themselves as extending, refining, completing, or
superseding JTP.

Derivative works may explore implications or applications, but must clearly
distinguish themselves from the principle itself.

---

## 6. Language Equivalence

This document has equal normative effect in all language versions.
No language version supersedes or overrides another.

---

## 7. Attribution Requirement

Any reference to JTP must attribute the original formulation as:

“Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP), Version 1.0  
by Daiki Kadowaki (2025)”

---

## 8. Final Clause

JTP is not designed to stabilize systems.
It exists to destabilize forgotten judgments.

Any use that neutralizes this function is incompatible with the principle.
