# Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)

## Overview

**Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)** is a **normative principle** concerning human–system interaction.

It asserts that when a system affects human actions or outcomes,  
**the existence, boundary, and delegation of judgment must be perceivable to the human user**.

JTP does **not** prescribe how systems should decide.  
It addresses **how human responsibility and agency are altered when judgments become imperceptible**.

## What This Is — and What It Is Not

### This document **is**:
- A **normative principle**
- An **original formulation** defining a conceptual boundary
- A foundation for **observation, discussion, and critique**

### This document **is not**:
- ❌ An implementation specification  
- ❌ A UI or UX guideline  
- ❌ An AI safety guarantee  
- ❌ A certification, checklist, or compliance framework  
- ❌ A claim about AI autonomy or “AI behavior”  

**JTP does not evaluate systems.  
It exposes when humans misperceive what was already decided.**

## Core Statement (Original Definition)

> Systems that influence human actions or outcomes must make the existence, boundary,  
> and delegation of judgment perceivable to the human user.  
>  
> Enforcing outcomes based on imperceptible judgments undermines human agency  
> by causing humans to forget what was already decided.

This is the **only authoritative definition** of JTP.

## Scope and Intent

JTP does **not** demand that judgment be returned to humans.  
It demands that **delegation itself be perceivable**.

The principle applies across domains, including but not limited to:
- Automated moderation and enforcement
- Algorithmic decision-making
- AI-assisted judgment systems
- Human–machine interfaces (HMI)

Its purpose is **not correction**, but **exposure**:
to reveal when responsibility is silently displaced.

## Position on Standardization and Compliance

The Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP) exists in a **category distinct** from standardization, certification, or compliance frameworks.

- **Non-Conformity**:
  JTP is a principle designed to maintain ethical tension and cannot be reduced to a fixed standard. Concepts such as "JTP Compliant" or "JTP Certified" fundamentally misrepresent and trivialize the nature of the principle.

- **Role as a Reference**:
  External organizations or standards bodies are not prevented from referencing JTP as a **foundational philosophy**. Indeed, JTP is intended to serve as a starting point for such discourse.

However, no guideline, system, or implementation may claim to **"fully satisfy"** JTP.  
Doing so would serve as an indulgence that conceals the very displacement of judgment JTP seeks to expose.
This position does not prohibit discussion, academic citation, or reference to JTP as a conceptual framework.

## Interpretation and Derivative Works

This repository defines the **Canonical Formulation** of the Judgment Transparency Principle.

For derivative works (guidelines, tools, systems, etc. that reference JTP), the following distinctions must be made clear:

1.  **Attribution to the Source**:
    Explicitly state that the work is informed by the Judgment Transparency Principle (Version 1.0) by Daiki Kadowaki.
2.  **Denial of Identity**:
    Explicitly state that the derivative work is **not** JTP itself, nor an authoritative implementation of it.

Recommended phrasing:
> *"This work is inspired by / references the Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP), but operates as an independent interpretation."*

## Language Versions

This document has **equal normative effect in all language versions**.

No language version supersedes another.  
All translations are anchored to the same original principle.

## Relation to Implementations and Patents

JTP is **independent of any implementation**.

Specific systems, techniques, or patents may serve as **observational instances** of the principle,  
but they do **not** define, complete, or constrain the principle itself.

**Reference for Substantiation (Proof of Feasibility):**
To demonstrate that this principle is technical reality rather than mere abstraction,
a specific system configuration by the author has been formally recorded as a **Patent Application (Patent Pending)**.
This serves not to claim "exclusive rights" over the principle,
but as a reference point for a **"Materialized Instance."**

The principle remains valid **with or without implementations**.

## Status

**Version 1.0 — Original Formulation**

This principle is **intentionally incomplete** and **cannot be finalized**.

Its role is to remain a point of tension  
where human responsibility would otherwise disappear.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve the original formulation
- Prevent silent redefinition
- Provide a stable reference point

It is **not** intended to conclude debate,  
but to ensure that debate does not erase its origin.
