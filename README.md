# Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)

## Overview

The Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP) is a normative principle concerning
human-system interaction.

It asserts that when a system affects human actions or outcomes,
the existence, boundary, and delegation of judgment must be perceivable
to the human affected.

JTP does not prescribe how systems should decide.
It concerns how human agency and responsibility are altered
when judgment becomes imperceptible.

## What This Repository Is - and Is Not

**This repository is:**
* A record of the canonical formulation of JTP
  as articulated in the original SSRN publication
* A stable reference point for citation and discussion
* A boundary marker that prevents silent redefinition

**This repository is not:**
* The original publication itself
* An implementation specification
* A UI / UX guideline
* A compliance checklist or certification framework
* A claim about system autonomy or behavior

The canonical and authoritative formulation of JTP
is defined in the original paper published on SSRN.

## Core Statement (Canonical Formulation)

Systems that influence human actions or outcomes must make the existence,
boundary, and delegation of judgment perceivable to the human affected.

Enforcing outcomes based on imperceptible judgments undermines human agency
by causing humans to forget what was already decided.

This statement reflects the canonical definition
as articulated in the original SSRN publication.

---

## Scope and Intent

JTP does not require that judgment be returned to humans.
It requires that delegation itself be perceivable.

The principle applies across domains, including but not limited to:
* Automated moderation and enforcement
* Algorithmic decision-making
* AI-assisted judgment systems
* Human-machine interfaces (HMI)

Its purpose is not correction but exposure:
to reveal when responsibility is silently displaced.

## Relation to Standards, Guidelines, and Policy

JTP exists as a normative reference, not as a standard.

Organizations, researchers, or policymakers may reference JTP
as a conceptual foundation.
However, no system, guideline, or framework can claim to
"fully satisfy" or "be compliant with" JTP.

Such claims would obscure the very displacement of judgment
the principle seeks to expose.

This position does not restrict discussion, citation,
or interpretive use of JTP.

## Interpretations and Derivative Works

This repository does not redefine JTP.

Derivative works that reference the Judgment Transparency Principle should:
1. Attribute the principle to its original formulation.
2. Clearly state that the work is an independent interpretation
   and not the principle itself.

**Suggested phrasing:**

> "This work references the Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)
> as articulated in the original SSRN publication
> and represents an independent interpretation."

## Language Versions

All language versions have equal normative standing.
No translation supersedes another.

---

## Relation to Implementations and Patents

JTP is independent of any implementation.

Specific systems or techniques may serve as observational instances
of the principle, but they do not define, complete, or constrain it.

A technical system by the author has been recorded as a patent application
to demonstrate feasibility, not ownership of the principle.

## Status

**Canonical Formulation (Record)**

The authoritative formulation of JTP
is defined in the original SSRN publication.

This repository exists to preserve,
reference, and contextualize that formulation,
not to replace it.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:
* Record the canonical formulation of JTP
  as articulated in the original SSRN publication
* Provide a stable reference point
* Prevent unintentional redefinition or dilution

It is not intended to conclude debate,
but to ensure that debate does not erase its origin.
