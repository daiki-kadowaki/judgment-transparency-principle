# Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)

## Overview

**Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP)** is a **normative principle** concerning human–system interaction.

It asserts that when a system affects human actions or outcomes,  
**the existence, boundary, and delegation of judgment must be perceivable to the human user**.

JTP does **not** prescribe how systems should decide.  
It addresses **how human responsibility and agency are altered when judgments become imperceptible**.

## What This Is — and What It Is Not

### This document **is**:
- A **normative principle**
- An **original formulation** defining a conceptual boundary
- A foundation for **observation, discussion, and critique**

### This document **is not**:
- ❌ An implementation specification  
- ❌ A UI or UX guideline  
- ❌ An AI safety guarantee  
- ❌ A certification, checklist, or compliance framework  
- ❌ A claim about AI autonomy or “AI behavior”  

**JTP does not evaluate systems.  
It exposes when humans misperceive what was already decided.**

## Core Statement (Original Definition)

> Systems that influence human actions or outcomes must make the existence, boundary,  
> and delegation of judgment perceivable to the human user.  
>  
> Enforcing outcomes based on imperceptible judgments undermines human agency  
> by causing humans to forget what was already decided.

This is the **only authoritative definition** of JTP.

## Scope and Intent

JTP does **not** demand that judgment be returned to humans.  
It demands that **delegation itself be perceivable**.

The principle applies across domains, including but not limited to:
- Automated moderation and enforcement
- Algorithmic decision-making
- AI-assisted judgment systems
- Human–machine interfaces

Its purpose is **not correction**, but **exposure**:
to reveal when responsibility is silently displaced.

## Non-Standardization and Non-Compliance Notice

Judgment Transparency Principle **must not** be standardized, certified, or treated as a compliance target.

- There is **no such thing** as “JTP-compliant” systems.
- JTP must **not** be converted into:
  - ISO / IEEE standards
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Checklists or design requirements
- Any attempt to operationalize JTP as a standard **misrepresents its nature**.

JTP exists to re-render perceptible judgments that have faded from human awareness,
not to stabilize institutional criteria.

## Interpretation and Derivative Works

This repository defines the **original formulation** of the Judgment Transparency Principle.

- Interpretations, discussions, or applications may extend this work,
  **but must not be represented as altering or superseding the original definition**.
- Use of the names **“Judgment Transparency Principle”** or **“JTP”**
  implies reference to this original formulation.

Derivative works must clearly distinguish:
- interpretation from definition  
- application from principle

## Language Versions

This document has **equal normative effect in all language versions**.

No language version supersedes another.  
All translations are anchored to the same original principle.

---

## Relation to Implementations and Patents

JTP is **independent of any implementation**.

Specific systems or techniques — including patented technologies —
may serve as **observational examples**,  
but they do **not** define, complete, or constrain the principle itself.

The principle remains valid **with or without implementations**.

## Status

Version 1.0 — Original formulation  
This principle is **intentionally incomplete** and **cannot be finalized**.

Its role is to remain a point of tension  
where human responsibility would otherwise disappear.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Preserve the original formulation
- Prevent silent redefinition
- Provide a stable reference point

It is **not** intended to conclude debate,  
but to ensure that debate does not erase its origin.
