# Counterfactual Analyses (Reserved)

This directory is intentionally reserved for future counterfactual analyses
related to the Judgment Transparency Principle (JTP).

These analyses are **not provided at this time**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to preserve a conceptual and archival space
for retrospective examinations of **accidents or systemic failures that did
not occur**, where such non-occurrence may later be reasonably attributed to
the presence, influence, or adoption of JTP-aligned principles.

Importantly, this repository **does not predict**, speculate about, or
anticipate specific incidents.

Any future documents placed here—if ever—will be written **only after**
sufficient historical, empirical, or institutional evidence becomes available.

---

## Methodological Position

Any counterfactual analysis, should it be authored in the future, must satisfy
all of the following conditions:

1. A demonstrable and publicly recognized risk of failure or harm existed.
2. The absence of the incident cannot be adequately explained by alternative
   technical, organizational, or social factors alone.
3. A plausible causal argument can be made that, without JTP-aligned structures,
   the incident would likely have occurred.

Until such conditions are met, **no counterfactual narrative is appropriate**.

---

## Scope and Non-Claims

This directory makes **no claim** that JTP has already prevented any specific
accident.

It exists solely to acknowledge that:
- Ethical and design principles may exert influence *before* measurable events occur.
- The historical evaluation of such influence is necessarily retrospective.

---

## Relationship to the Original JTP Formulation

The original formulation of the Judgment Transparency Principle is documented
separately (e.g., SSRN and associated canonical references).

This directory is **not part of the canonical formulation**.
It is a reserved extension for future historical analysis only.

## Status

Current status: **Intentionally empty**

This emptiness is deliberate.
